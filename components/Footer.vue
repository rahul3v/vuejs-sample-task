    <h5>Home Icon Pack</h5>

    <p>
      There is no other place like home. We realized the value of our homes
      especially in difficult times like the global pandemic where we got stuck
      and the only place, we had was our home. To reflect the importance of our
      happy place, we have designed the most beautiful icon collection based on
      homes. Check them out!
    </p>

    <p>
      The illustrations consist of different activities that individuals do
      inside their homes and the 3D collection is smoothly designed with a
      creative touch. The icons are available in all file formats and different
      styles as other icons.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also change the color of the icons by using the icon color editor
      if you donâ€™t want the default color. We have also designed certain icon
      packs like home icon pack, smart home icon pack, home tools icon pack,
      home appliance icon pack, and many others. Do have a look.
